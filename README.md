# NaturalCrit
A tool suite for DMs to use for D&D


### Getting started
1. Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Clone down the repo
1. In your terminal, head to the repo
1. Run `npm install` to get all the dependacies
2. Run `npm install -g gulp` to install the gulp build tool
1. Run `gulp fresh`, this will compile and build all the needed libraries (this only has to be done once, unless you add more libs)
1. Run `gulp` to run the project locally. Should be accessible at `localhost:8000`
2. Any changes to files within the proejct will be detected and the propject will automatically re-build

**Notes:** If you'd like to create and edit homebrews, you'll need to have MongoDB installed and running.

Have fun!
