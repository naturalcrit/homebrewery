# The Homebrewery
Create authentic looking D&D homebrews using only markdown. Check it out [here](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com).

If you want to locally run your own version, or just play around with the code you see here, follow the instructions below.


### Getting started running your own version locally.
1. Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Clone down the repo
1. In your terminal, head to the repo
1. Run `npm install` to get all the dependencies
1. Run `npm run libs`, this will compile and build all the needed libraries (this only has to be done once, unless you add more libs)
1. Run `npm run watch` to run the project locally. Should be accessible at `localhost:8000`
2. Any changes to files within the project will be detected and the project will automatically re-build

**Notes:** If you'd like to create and edit homebrews, you'll need to have MongoDB installed and running.

Have fun!
