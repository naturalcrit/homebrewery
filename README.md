## Quick Start
The easiest way to get started using the Homebrewery is to use it
[on our website][homebrewery-url]. The code is open source, so feel free to
clone it, tinker with it. If you want to make changes to the code, you can run
your own local version for testing by following the installation instructions
below.

### Installation
First, install three programs that the Homebrewery requires to run and retrieve
updates:

1. install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. install [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Community version)

    For easiest installation, follow these steps:
    1. In the installer, uncheck the option to run as a service
    1. You can install MongoDB Compass if you want a GUI to view your database documents
    1. Go to the C drive and create a folder called "data"
    1. Inside the "data" folder, create a new folder called "db"
    1. Open a command prompt or other terminal and navigate to your mongodb install folder (c:program files\mongo\server\4.4\bin)
    1. In the command prompt, run "mongod", which will start up your local database server
    1. While MongoD is running, open a second command prompt and navigate to the mongodb install folder
    1. In the second command prompt, run "mongo", which allows you to edit the database
    1. Type `use homebrewery` to create the homebrewery database. You should see `switched to db homebrewery`
    1. Type `db.brews.insert({"title":"test"})` to create a blank document. You should see `WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })`
    1. Search in Windows for "Advanced system settings" and open it
    1. Click "Environment variables", find the "path" variable, and double-click to open it
    1. Click "New" and paste in the path to the mongodb "bin" folder
    1. Click "OK", "OK", "OK" to close all the windows
1. install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (select the option that allows Git to run from the command prompt)

Checkout the repo ([documentation][github-clone-repo-docs-url]):
```
git clone https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery.git
```

[github-clone-repo-docs-url]: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Second, you will need to add the environment variable `NODE_ENV=local` to allow
the project to run locally.

You can set this temporarily in your shell of choice:
* Windows Powershell: `$env:NODE_ENV="local"`
* Windows CMD: `set NODE_ENV=local`
* Linux / OSX: `export NODE_ENV=local`

Third, you will need to install the Node dependencies, compile the app, and run
it using the two commands:

1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`

You should now be able to go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
in your browser and use the Homebrewery offline.

### Running the application via Docker

Please see the docs here: [README.DOCKER.md](./README.DOCKER.md)

### Running the application on FreeBSD or FreeNAS

Please see the docs here: [README.FreeBSD.md](./README.FREEBSD.md)

### Standalone PHB Stylesheet
If you just want the stylesheet that is generated to make pages look like they
are from the Player's Handbook, you will find it in the
[phb.standalone.css](./phb.standalone.css) file.

If you are developing locally and would like to generate your own, follow the
above steps and then run `npm run phb`.
