### Saturday, 11/09/2021 - v3.0.0

We have been working on v3 for a *very* long time. We want to thank everyone for being paitent.


Some features planned for V3 have actually been released over the recent months as part of V2, and some are still on the way. But at its core, V3 provides brand new Markdown-to-Brew rendering system, which was no simple task. This has opened up access to all sorts of bugfixes, tweaks, and potential for new features that just wouldn't be possible on the old system.

***BE WARNED:*** As we continue to develop V3, expect small tweaks in the styling, fonts, and snippets; your brews may look slightly different from day-to-day; some things might break completely while we tackle any bugs in this early stage. All of your old documents will continue to work as normal. We are not touching them. If you don't want to deal With the possibility of slight formatting changes, you may choose to stick with the Legacy renderer on any of your brews for as long as you like. However, most new features added from now on will only be available for brews using the V3 renderer.

Massive changelog incoming:

#### Markdown+
With the latest major update to *The Homebrewery*, we've implemented an extended Markdown-like syntax for block and span elements, plus a few other changes, eliminating the need for HTML tags like `div`, and `span` in most cases. This should hopefully aid non-coders with readability, and also allows us a few tricks in the background to fix some old issues. No raw HTML tags should be needed in a brew, and going forward, raw HTML will no longer receive debugging support (*but can still be used if you insist*).

All brews made prior to the release of v3.0.0 will still render normally, and you may switch between the "Legacy" brew renderer and the newer "V3" renderer via the {{fa,fa-info-circle}} **Properties** button  on your brew. Much of the syntax and styling has changed in V3, so code in one version may be broken in the other.

Visit [this page](/v3_preview) for brief examples of the new syntax!

#### Extended Markdown Syntax:

{{taskList
* [x] Add Divs and Spans for all your custom styling needs, via a simplified Markdown-like syntax:
  ```
  {{myDivClass,#myId,color:red
  My Div content
  }}

  Hello {{mySpan,color:blue World}} !
  ```

  Fixes issues: [#348](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/348)
}}

\column

{{taskList
* [x] Add inline CSS to Markdown objects via "curly injection" syntax:
  ```
  Hello *world*{myClass,#id,color:red}
  ```
  Fixes issues: [#403](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/403)

* [x] Rowspan, Colspan, and multiple header rows with extended table syntax:
```
| Header 1a | Header 1b | Header 1c |
| Header 2a | Header 2b | Header 2c |
|:---------:|:----------|:---------:|
| Span 2 columns       || Span 2    |
| one col   |  one col  | rows     ^|
```
  Fixes issues: [#773](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/773), [#191](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/191)

* [x] Hanging indents via `<dl>` tags, as seen in the **PHB → Spell** snippet. Add via "double-colon" syntax:
```
Term :: big long definition that bleeds onto multiple lines
```
  Fixes issues: [#182](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/182), [#149](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/149)

* [x] Easier vertical spacing via colons alone on a line:
  ```
   :::
  ```
  Fixes issues: [#374](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/374)

* [x] Avoid paragraph indendation by ending the previous paragraph with a backslash `\` or two spaces `  `
  ```
  Paragraph one\
  Paragraph two
  ```
  Fixes issues: [#636](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/636)

* [x] Code blocks can be inserted by surrounding it with rows of three backticks ` ``` `, for demonstration purposes or to share custom styles. Inline-code can be inserted with single backticks <code>&#96;code&#96;</code>
 <pre><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;
 Here is some code!
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

  Fixes issues: [#465](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery/issues/465)

### Under-the-Hood Stuff
We had to make a whole lot of background upgrades and changes to get all of this working, and now that the framework is in place, there's a lot more planned and upcoming *"sometime"* :

### Saturday, 04/06/2016 - v2.2.0
- Migrating The Homebrewery over to hombrewery.naturalcrit.com. It now runs on it's own server, with it's own repo separate from the other tools I'm working on. Makes updating and deploying much easier.

### Sunday, 29/05/2016 - v2.1.0
- Finally added a syntax for doing spell lists. A bit in-depth about why this took so long. Essentially I'm running out of syntax to use in stardard Markdown. There are too many unique elements in the PHB-style to be mapped. I solved this earlier by stacking certain elements together (eg. an `<hr>` before a `blockquote` turns it into moster state block), but those are getting unweildly. I would like to simply wrap these in `div`s with classes, but unfortunately Markdown stops processing when within HTML blocks. To get around this I wrote my own override to the Markdown parser and lexer to process Markdown within a simple div class wrapper. This should open the door for more unique syntaxes in the future. Big step!
- Override Ctrl+P (and cmd+P) to launch to the print page. Many people try to just print either the editing or share page to get a PDF. While this dones;t make much sense, I do get a ton of issues about it. So now if you try to do this, it'll just bring you imediately to the print page. Everybody wins!
- The onboarding flow has also been confusing a few users (Homepage -> new -> save -> edit page). If you edit the Homepage text now, a Call to Action to save your work will pop-up.
- Added a 'Recently Edited' and 'Recently Viewed' nav item to the edit and share page respectively. Each will remember the last 8 items you edited or viewed and when you viewed it. Makes use of the new title attribute of brews to easy navigatation.
- Paragraphs now indent properly after lists (thanks u/slitjen!)

### Friday, 27/05/2016 - v2.0.6
- Updated the issue template for (hopefully) better reporting
- Added suggestion to use chrome while PDF printing

### Wednesday, 25/05/2016 -v2.0.5
- The class table generators have the proper ability score improvement progression.

\page

### Tuesday, 24/05/2016 - v2.0.4
- Fixed extra wide monster stat blocks sometimes only being one column
- The class table generators now follow the proper progression from the PHB (thakns u/IrishBandit)

### Thursday, 19/05/2016 - v2.0.2

- No longer server-side pre-render brews, just incase the user entered invalid HTML, it might crahsh the server
- Bumped up the allowed entity size for extra-large brew (Thanks for reporting it dickboner93)
- Added a little error box when a save fails with a custom link to reporting the issue on github.

### Saturday, 14/05/2016 - v2.0.0 (finally!)

I've been working on v2 for a *very* long time. I want to thank you guys for being paitent.
It started rather small, but as more and more features were added, I decided to just wait until everything was polished.

Massive changelog incoming:

#### Brews
- New flow for creating new brews. Before creating a new brew would immedaitely create a brew in the database and let you edit it. Many people would create a new brew just to experiment and close it, which lead to many "abandoned brews" (see the Under the hood section below). This started eating up a ton of database space. You now have to manually save a new brew for the first time, however Homebrewery will store anything you don't have saved in local storage, just in case your browser crashes or whatever, it will load that up when you go back to `/homebrew/new`
- Black blocking edges around notes and stat blocks when printing to PDFs have been fixed
- Borders sometimes not showing up in the second column have been fixed
- All pseudo-element borders have been replaced with reliable border images.
- Chrome can finally print to PDF as good as Chrome Canary! Updating instructions.
- Added a little page number box.
- Added in a new editable Brew Title. This will be shown in the navbar on share pages, and will default to the file name when you save as PDF. All exsisting brews will be defaulted with an empty title.
- Mutliline lists render better now
- Firefox rendering has been slithgly improved. Firefox and Chrome render things **slightly** differently, over the course of a brew, these little changes add up and lead to very noticable rendering differences between the browsers. I'm trying my best to get Firefox rendering better, but it's a difficult problem.
- A bunch of you have wanted to donate to me. I am super flattered by that. I created a [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/stolksdorf). If you feel like helping out, head here :)

#### Under the Hood Stuff
- Setup a proper staging environment. Will be using this for tests, and hopefully getting the community to help me test future versions
- Server-side prerendering now much faster
- Regular weekly database back-ups. Your brews are safe!
- Database is now uniquely indexed on both editId and shareId, page loads/saving should be much faster
- Improved Admin console. This helps me answer people's questions about issues with their brews
- Added a whole querying/pagniation API that I can use for stats and answering questions
- Clearing out "Abandoned" brews (smaller than a tweet and haven't been viewed for a week). These account for nearly a third of all stored brews.

#### Interface
- Added in a whole new editor with syntax highlighting for markdown
- Built a splitpane! Remembers where you left the split in between sessions
- Re-organized the snippets into a hierarchical groups. Should be much easier to find what you need
- Partial page rendering is working. The Homebrewery will now only load the viewable pages, and any page with `<style>` tags on them. If you are working on a large brew you should notice *significant* performance improvements
- Edit page saving interface has been improved significantly. Auto-saves after 3 seconds on inactivity, now allows user to save at anytime. Will stop the tab from closing witha  pop-up if there are unsaved changes.
- Navbar and overall style has been improved and spacing made more consistent
- Elements under the hood are way more organized and should behaviour much more reliably in many sizes.
- Source now opens to it's own route `/source/:sharedId` instead of just a window. Now easier to share, and won't be blocked by some browsers.
- Print page now auto-opens print dialog. If you want to share your print page link, just remove the `?dialog=true` parameter and it won't open the dialog.

### Wednesday, 20/04/2016
- A lot of admin improvements. Pagninated brew table
- Added a searching and removing abandoned brew api endpoints (turns out about 40% of brews are shorter that a tweet!).
- Fixed the require cache being cleared. Pages should render a bit faster now.
- Pulled in `kkragenbrink`s fix for nested lists, Thanks!


### Wednesday, 06/04/2016 - v1.4
* Pages will now partially render. This should greatly speed up *very* large homebrews. The Homebreery will figure out which page you should be looking at and render that page, the page before, and the page after.
