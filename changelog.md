# changelog


### Wednesday, 20/04/2016
- A lot of admin improvements. Pagninated brew table
- Added a searching and removing abandoned brew api endpoints (turns out about 40% of brews are shorter that a tweet!).
- Fixed the require cache being cleared. Pages should render a bit faster now.

### Wednesday, 06/04/2016 - v1.4
* Pages will now partially render. This should greatly speed up *very* large homebrews. The Homebreery will figure out which page you should be looking at and render that page, the page before, and the page after.
* Zooming should be fixed. I've changed the font size units to be cm, which match the units of the page. Zooming in and out now look much better.
