			The Homebrewery cannot delete files from Google Drive on its own, so there
			are three most likely possibilities:
			:
			- **The Google Drive files may have been accidentally deleted.** Look in
			the Google Drive account that owns this brew (or ask the owner to do so),
			and make sure the Homebrewery folder is still there, and that it holds your brews
			as text files.
			- **You may have changed the sharing settings for your files.** If the files
			are still on Google Drive, change all of them to be shared *with everyone who has
			the link* so the Homebrewery can access them.
			- **The Google Account may be closed.** Google may have removed the account
			due to inactivity or violating a Google policy. Make sure the owner can
			still access Google Drive normally and upload/download files to it.
			:
			If the file isn't found, Google Drive usually puts your file in your Trash folder for
			30 days. Assuming the trash hasn't been emptied yet, it might be worth checking.
			You can also find the Activity tab on the right side of the Google Drive page, which
			shows the recent activity on Google Drive. This can help you pin down the exact date
			the brew was deleted or moved, and by whom.
			:
			If the brew still isn't found, some people have had success asking Google to recover
			accidentally deleted files at this link: 
			https://support.google.com/drive/answer/1716222?hl=en&ref_topic=7000946.
			At the bottom of the page there is a button that says *Send yourself an Email*
			and you will receive instructions on how to request the files be restored.
			:
			Also note, if you prefer not to use your Google Drive for storage, you can always
			change the storage location of a brew by clicking the Google drive icon by the
			brew title and choosing *transfer my brew to/from Google Drive*.`,
