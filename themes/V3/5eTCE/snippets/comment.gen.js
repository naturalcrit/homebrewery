Esteemed Wizard,
:
I have sensed your presence, adopted daughter of Baba Yaga. My keen eyes watch your every move, and my ancient heart knows the secrets you seek. As the Great Black Dragon of the West, I offer you a chance to unveil the mysteries of this world. Meet me at the full moon's rise in the whispering forest, and the knowledge you seek shall be yours. Do not delay, for time is a mere wisp in the grand tapestry of our existence.

:

With anticipation,

The Great Black Dragon of the West
