<p>Welcome traveler from an antique land. Please sit and tell us of what you have seen. The unheard of monsters, who slither and bite. Tell us of the wondrous items and and artifacts you have found, their mysteries yet to be unlocked. Of the vexing vocations and surprising skills you have seen.</p>
<h3 id="homebrew-dd-made-easy">Homebrew D&amp;D made easy</h3>
<p>The Homebrewery makes the creation and sharing of authentic looking Fifth-Edition homebrews easy. It uses <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/">Markdown</a> with a little CSS magic to make your brews come to life.</p>
<p><strong>Try it!</strong> Simply edit the text on the left and watch it <em>update live</em> on the right.</p>
<h3 id="editing-and-sharing">Editing and Sharing</h3>
<p>When you create your own homebrew you will be given a <em>edit url</em> and a <em>share url</em>.  Any changes you make will be automatically saved to the database within a few seconds. Anyone with the edit url will be able to make edits to your homebrew. So be careful about who you share it with.</p>
<p>Anyone with the <em>share url</em> will be able to access a read-only version of your homebrew.</p>

<h5 id="pdf-exporting">PDF Exporting</h5>
<p>PDF Printing works best in Chrome. If you are having quality/consistency issues, try using Chrome to print instead.</p>
<p>After clicking the &quot;Print&quot; item in the navbar a new page will open and a print dialog will pop-up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the <strong>Destination</strong> to &quot;Save as PDF&quot;</li>
<li>Set <strong>Paper Size</strong> to &quot;Letter&quot;</li>
<li>If you are printing on A4 paper, make sure to have the &quot;A4 page size snippet&quot; in your brew</li>
<li>In <strong>Options</strong> make sure &quot;Background Images&quot; is selected.</li>
<li>Hit print and enjoy! You&#39;re done!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to save ink or have a monochrome printer, add the <strong>Ink Friendly</strong> snippet to your brew before you print</p>

<p>With the latest major update to <em>The Homebrewery</em> we&#39;ve implemented an extended Markdown-like syntax for block and span elements, plus a few other changes, eliminating the need for HTML tags like <strong>div</strong> and <strong>span</strong> in most cases. No raw HTML tags should be needed in a brew, and going forward, raw HTML will no longer receive debugging support (<em>but can still be used if you insist</em>).</p>
<p><strong>You can enable V3 via the <span class="fa fa-info-circle" style="text-indent:0"></span> Properties button!</strong></p>

<h3 id="not-quite-markdown">Not quite Markdown</h3>
<p>Although the Homebrewery uses Markdown, to get all the styling features from the PHB, we had to get a little creative. Some base HTML elements are not used as expected and I&#39;ve had to include a few new keywords.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Horizontal Rules</strong> are generally used to <em>modify</em> existing elements into a different style. For example, a horizontal rule before a blockquote will give it the style of a Monster Stat Block instead of a note.</li>
<li><strong>New Pages</strong> are controlled by the author. It&#39;s impossible for the site to detect when the end of a page is reached, so indicate you&#39;d like to start a new page, use the new page snippet to get the syntax.</li>
<li><strong>Code Blocks</strong> are used only to indicate column breaks. Since they don&#39;t allow for styling within them, they weren&#39;t that useful to use.</li>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> can be used to get <em>just</em> the right look for your homebrew. I&#39;ve included some examples in the snippet icons above the editor.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
</code></pre><h3 id="images">Images</h3>
<p>Images must be hosted online somewhere, like imgur. You use the address to that image to reference it in your brew. Images can be included &#39;inline&#39; with the text using Markdown-style images. However for background images more control is needed.</p>
<p>Background images should be included as HTML-style img tags. Using inline CSS you can precisely position your image where you&#39;d like it to be. I have added both a inflow image snippet and a background image snippet to give you exmaples of how to do it.</p>
<h3 id="crediting-me">Crediting Me</h3>
<p>If you&#39;d like to credit The Homebrewery in your brew, I&#39;d be flattered! Just reference that you made it with The Homebrewery.</p>
