    The Homebrewery cannot delete files from Google Drive on its own, so there
    are three most likely possibilities:
    :
    - **The Google Drive files may have been accidentally deleted.** Look in
    the Google Drive account that owns this brew (or ask the owner to do so),
    and make sure the Homebrewery folder is still there, and that it holds your brews
    as text files.
    - **You may have changed the sharing settings for your files.** If the files
    are still on Google Drive, change all of them to be shared *with everyone who has
    the link* so the Homebrewery can access them.
    - **The Google Account may be closed.** Google may have removed the account
    due to inactivity or violating a Google policy. Make sure the owner can
    still access Google Drive normally and upload/download files to it.
    :
    If the file isn't found, Google Drive usually puts your file in your Trash folder for
    30 days. Assuming the trash hasn't been emptied yet, it might be worth checking.
    You can also find the Activity tab on the right side of the Google Drive page, which
    shows the recent activity on Google Drive. This can help you pin down the exact date
    the brew was deleted or moved, and by whom.
    :
    If the brew still isn't found, some people have had success asking Google to recover
    accidentally deleted files at this link: 
    https://support.google.com/drive/answer/1716222?hl=en&ref_topic=7000946.
    At the bottom of the page there is a button that says *Send yourself an Email*
    and you will receive instructions on how to request the files be restored.
    :
    Also note, if you prefer not to use your Google Drive for storage, you can always
    change the storage location of a brew by clicking the Google drive icon by the
    brew title and choosing *transfer my brew to/from Google Drive*.
